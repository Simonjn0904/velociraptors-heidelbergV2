**Social Ride ☀️🚴‍♂️**

📌 Uferstraße 4, Heidelberg  
⏰ Every Saturday, 10:00 AM

Every Saturday, we organize a group ride – with a clear focus on the social aspect: the pace is relaxed and invites conversation 🗣️, the vibe is excellent ✨, and most importantly: the ride usually ends with a coffee stop ☕. Beginners, gravel riders 🚵‍♂️, and anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable in performance-focused groups are especially welcome. The pace is adjusted so that even the slowest rider can join in without feeling pressured 🐢. The weekly route is announced in the WhatsApp Announcements Group 📱.

**Fast Ride ⚡🚴‍♀️**
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

📌 Uferstraße 4, Heidelberg  
⏰ Every Sunday, 10:30 AM  
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

Sundays are more performance-oriented: on certain sections, we challenge each other 💨 – but regroup after every segment 🤝. You should feel comfortable riding in a group and drafting 🌀 – but no specific average speed is required 🚫🏁. It’s more about enjoying some friendly competition than chasing numbers 🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️💪. Each ride is led by someone 👋 who makes sure everyone is comfortable with the pace and group dynamic. We alternate between flat routes along the Rhine 🌊 and hillier ones ⛰️. The principle stays the same: we ride fast, we push each other – but no one gets left behind 🫂. Even when the pace is high and your legs are burning 🧬😉 – we look out for each other and finish the ride together.
