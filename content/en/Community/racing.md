**Open Races**  
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

We regularly take part in open races – exciting events for ambitious amateur cyclists. For these races, we also have dedicated subgroups in our WhatsApp community – for example for the Hamburg Cyclassics, the Rad Race 120, or Eschborn Frankfurt.

**Licensed Races**  
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

Some members of our group also participate in official licensed races around the Heidelberg area – mostly in Baden and Rhineland-Palatinate. If you have questions about licensed racing, feel free to reach out to Kilian, Moritz, or Simon. Most of us get our racing license through RSV Heidelberg. Licenses in German cycling are managed centrally through the rad-net platform by the German Cycling Federation (BDR).
