**Licensed Races**
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

Some members of our group also participate in official licensed races in the Heidelberg region â€“ mainly in Baden and Rhineland-Palatinate. Most of us obtain our racing license through RSV Heidelberg. The general license management in German cycling is centrally handled via the rad-net platform of the German Cycling Federation (BDR). Our long-term goal is to build a registered licensed team. So, if you feel like racing multiple events per year and can commit to planning, we would be excited to tackle this together with you. If you have questions about licensed races, Kilian, Moritz, and Simon are happy to help.

**Race Calendar**
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

You are welcome to add races and other events (both open and licensed) to the table below. The dates indicated should ideally apply to the next race as soon as this information becomes available (if the date is in the past, it was obviously not updated). Please note that it often pays off to register as soon as possible since places can be limited and prices may rise. To keep the number of separate groups in the community as low as possible, we maintain the group "Races (+other events)". Here, we can generally exchange information until more detailed planning begins.
