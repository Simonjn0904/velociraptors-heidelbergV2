**Your chance to get involved**  
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

Our organization group is the heart of the Velociraptors community. This is where we plan the weekly rides, coordinate events, design our merch, and shape our public presence.  
Since we're not a registered club and work without rigid hierarchies, we have the freedom to implement ideas easily and develop structures flexibly.  
We welcome new perspectives and people who want to take on responsibility – or just contribute their thoughts.  
If you'd like to get involved, become part of the Orga Team.  
You’ll find the link to the WhatsApp group in our general community chat.  
You're also very welcome to join our organization meetings. The dates are listed in the calendar on our website.
