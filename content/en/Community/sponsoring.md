VELOciraptors Heidelberg is much more than just a group of cycling enthusiasts. We stand for community, movement, openness, and inclusive access to cycling – regardless of performance, background, or financial means. To maintain and further develop our current activities – such as rides, group training, and our own merchandise – we rely on financial support.  
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

Through sponsorships, we aim not only to strengthen our visual identity – with things like new jerseys, bottles, or organizational materials – but also to create space for new ideas and initiatives. These include planning an open cycling race in Heidelberg that brings together people of all performance levels, as well as implementing socially engaged projects in the cycling world: such as a mobile repair station, rental race bikes for people with limited financial resources, or youth cycling support. Our overarching goal is to make cycling more accessible – especially for those who have previously been excluded.

As a sponsor or partner, you’ll be part of this journey. You’ll gain visibility – for example, on our website, social media, or our jerseys – and demonstrate your commitment to a sustainable, healthy, and community-driven cycling culture in Heidelberg. Every contribution helps stabilize and expand the VELOciraptors project and make it accessible to a wider audience.
