You’d love to join a Social Ride, but don’t have the right bike? 🚴‍♀ You want to try riding a road bike a few times before buying your own? 💸 Your bike just got stolen and your cycling date next week is in danger? 😬  
Then check out the Bike Exchange, reach out to people offering bikes in your size, and set up a time to borrow and return one! 🌟

This idea came about because we talked to lots of people who have 2 or 3 great bikes sitting in their garage – while many others struggle to get into cycling because of the high cost.  
That means cycling is often only accessible to those who can afford it. It excludes a lot of people, reinforces elitist attitudes, and fosters social cliques in the cycling world.  
We want to actively counter that – and offer a concrete alternative. ✊🚲

For this concept to work, we need your support!  
If you have a bike you’d consider lending out, please add it to the list!  
And: help spread the word. We know most folks in this group probably do own bikes – so tell your friends and people you know that this option exists, and share the link if they might be interested!
