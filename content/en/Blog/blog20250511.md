Hey everyone, on Sunday May 25 the Heidelberger Panoramatour is happening again – the annual RTF (Cycling Tour Ride) hosted by RSV 🥳.  
Last year a few of us joined, mostly for the 142k route – it was a lot of fun, and this year we’re hoping to ride with an even bigger group.  
All routes start along the Neckar, which means we can ride the first stretch together as one big group before splitting up.

If you're up for it, register online to get the reduced price, and please react to this message with the number of the route you'd most likely want to ride (no stress – nothing's binding and you can still change your mind during the ride).  
This helps us get a feel for the group size and helps others decide too 😊  
(Feel free to post in the group if the start time doesn’t work for you – chances are you’re not the only one!)
