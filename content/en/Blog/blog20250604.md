📌 Collegium Academicum

⏰ 14.06. 12:00 - 15.06. ~12:00

🗺 4 laps (200k, 125k, 125k, 50k) in succession

🫶 would be really cool if as many people as possible joined the last social lap

TLDR: we'll attempt to ride 500km in 24 hours as a group, split into 4 loops - feel free to join for as much or as little as you like! 😊

Hey everyone, we're really excited to finally share more info about the planned 24hr Ride in two weeks!
<div style="margin-top: 1.0rem;"></div>

**The Goal**

The goal is simple: we ride 500km in one ride. The extra challenge would be to complete the distance in under 24 hours – but we’re not too worried about that. The most important thing is that we all finish the 500km together, no matter how long it takes. That means we try to keep a solid pace, take relatively short breaks, but still adapt the speed to the group, and don’t do any sprints etc. You’re welcome to ride in the slipstream the whole time and let the stronger ones pull – we support each other as a group.

**The Loops**

To make the attempt safer and to let more people join or drop out, we split the 500km into several smaller loops (see below). You’re absolutely welcome to join for just one or two loops – we don’t expect many people to be masochistic enough to want to ride 500km in one go, but the more people join, the better the vibe, even if it's just for a short stretch. You can also start riding without knowing how long you’ll stay with us – and on the longer routes, there are definitely many options to return by train.

**The Plan**

We meet from 11:30 to 11:45 at the CA bike workshop (https://collegiumacademicum.de/fahrradwerkstatt/) to set up a supply station where we can regroup and recharge between loops. At 12:00 we’ll set off punctually and try to roughly stick to the following plan:

12:00 - 21:30: Easy Miles 💨 – 200km along the Neckar Valley and back via Kraichgau

21:30 - 03:30: Into the Night 🌠 – 125k westward (towards Neustadt)

03:30 - 09:30: End of the Tunnel 🌅 – 125k southward (towards Karlsruhe)

09:30 - 12:00: Social Loop 🥰 – 50k northward

The timetable is of course just an estimate (and rather optimistic) – we’ll post regular updates in the group so you can better estimate our arrival time if you want to join for the later loops.

**Routes**

We’ll send out the exact routes and a checklist of things everyone should bring soon. Until then, we’re already looking forward to the challenge! We hope it inspires you to ride a new distance PR 😊
