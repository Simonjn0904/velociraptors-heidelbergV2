Hey everyone! It's finally getting warm enough again to have some nice off-bike socials outside 🥳  
There are so many of us now at the Social Ride, and we’re excited to get to know you all better.

😋 Bring something to eat/drink (and share!)

🏀 Please bring picnic blankets if you have any! Spikeball or other games would be great too 

🖤 Friends are welcome – they don’t have to be into cycling!

We’re looking forward to a relaxed evening together without bikes.
