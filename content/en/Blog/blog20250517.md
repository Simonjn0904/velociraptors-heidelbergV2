**🧺 Pic(k)nic(k)**

📌 Neckarwiese (we’ll send a more precise location on the day)

⏰ 23.05 18:00–22:00

Hey everyone! It's finally getting warm enough again to have some nice off-bike socials outside 🥳  
There are so many of us now at the Social Ride, and we’re excited to get to know you all better.

😋 Bring something to eat/drink (and share!)

🏀 Please bring picnic blankets if you have any! Spikeball or other games would be great too  
🖤 Friends are welcome – they don’t have to be into cycling!

We’re looking forward to a relaxed evening together without bikes.
